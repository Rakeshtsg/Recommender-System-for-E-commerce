# Recommender-System-for-E-commerce
Problem Statement: Build a recommender system that suggests products to users based on their preferences and behavior. Use a dataset like the Amazon Customer Reviews (Electronics) dataset.

Introduction
Recommender systems are a powerful tool for enhancing user engagement and satisfaction in e-commerce platforms. By analyzing user preferences and behavior, these systems can suggest products that are likely to be of interest to individual users, leading to increased sales and customer loyalty. This project aims to build a recommender system for an e-commerce website using the Amazon Customer Reviews (Electronics) dataset.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a recommender system that suggests relevant products to users based on their past purchases, browsing history, and product ratings. The system should be able to capture user preferences and identify patterns in their behavior to personalize recommendations effectively.

Dataset
The Amazon Customer Reviews (Electronics) dataset contains over 2 million reviews for various electronic products. The dataset includes information such as product ID, user ID, rating, and review text. This rich data source will be used to train and evaluate the recommender system.

Proposed Approach
The recommender system will be implemented using a collaborative filtering algorithm, which is a popular technique for recommending products based on user similarities. Collaborative filtering algorithms assume that users with similar preferences will likely be interested in similar products. The system will analyze past user interactions and identify users with similar behavior patterns to generate personalized recommendations.

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the recommender system will be evaluated using various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will assess the system's ability to accurately identify and recommend relevant products to users.

Project Plan
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the Amazon Customer Reviews (Electronics) dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as user-product interactions and product categories.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate collaborative filtering algorithm, such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering.

Model Training: Train the recommender system using the selected algorithm and the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommender system using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Deploy the recommender system into a production environment and integrate it with the e-commerce website.
